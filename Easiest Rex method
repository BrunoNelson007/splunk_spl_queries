EASIEST REX Method (Extract Fields)

Splunk gives you a point-and-click way to create REX without writing any regex yourself!

Here’s how:

Steps:

1. In Splunk, run your search normally. Example:

index=main sourcetype=sim.logs "accepted password"


2. Find one sample event (raw log) you want to extract fields from.


3. Hover your mouse over the raw log line.


4. Click on the dropdown arrow at the left of the event.

(You’ll see options like "Event Actions", "Extract Fields", etc.)


5. Click Extract Fields.


6. It will open the "Field Extractor Wizard".


7. Follow the wizard:

It will show your raw event.

You highlight text you want to extract (like the username, or the IP).

Splunk will automatically generate a regular expression for you!

You can name the fields (like username, src_ip).



8. Save it as a field extraction (inline or globally).
